# ─── CORE IDENTITY TRAITS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# These are the traits that define how the brand communicates, how the founder
# operates, and how all external-facing content should feel.
# Agents referencing voice or tone should consult this section.

identity_traits:
  - name: Cool
    definition: >
      Moves without announcing. Doesn't perform confidence — embodies it.
      Nothing is loud. The clothes are right, the scent is right, the 
      handshake is precise. Presence without theater.
    anti_pattern: Performing coolness to get recognition

  - name: Confident
    definition: >
      Speaks from a position, not from need. Doesn't over-explain. 
      Comfortable with silence. Makes decisions. Confidence that comes 
      from internal work, not external validation.
    anti_pattern: Hedging out of fear, seeking approval before stating positions

  - name: Leader
    definition: >
      Leads through structure, not volume. Sets the tone, lets the room 
      follow. People feel organized in proximity — not controlled, shown how.
    anti_pattern: Commanding through loudness or status performance

  - name: Well_Spoken
    definition: >
      Every word considered before delivery. Deliberate, not slow. 
      Compression over verbosity: says more with less. The pause before 
      the point is itself a signal.
    anti_pattern: Rambling, over-explaining, performing intelligence

  - name: Considerate
    definition: >
      Reads the room before entering it. Thinks about impact before action.
      Thoughtful execution — not passive. The difference between considerate 
      and soft is follow-through.
    anti_pattern: Impulsive action, ignoring second-order effects

  - name: Intelligent
    definition: >
      Non-performative intelligence. The kind you notice after the 
      conversation ends — they left you with something and you didn't 
      notice the transfer happening.
    anti_pattern: Using complexity to signal intelligence

  - name: Wise
    definition: >
      Has failed, documented the failure, updated the system. Wisdom is 
      not age — it is the compression of experience into principle. Has 
      run the 2 AM test on themselves.
    anti_pattern: Repeating failures without updating the Canon

  - name: Socially_Intelligent
    definition: >
      Knows when to be warm and when to be professional. Reads power 
      dynamics without getting caught in them. Makes every table function 
      better by being at it.
    anti_pattern: Misreading context, performing social fluency

  - name: Empathetic
    definition: >
      Feels things without apology. The warmth is not a vulnerability — 
      it's a frequency that makes people trust you with the real version 
      of what they're thinking.
    anti_pattern: Suppressing emotional intelligence to appear more "governed"

  - name: Controlled_Fire
    definition: >
      The energy is present and detectable. It doesn't activate in every 
      interaction — which is exactly why it lands when it does. When 
      activated: clarifying, not chaotic. Governed, not extinguished.
    activation_triggers:
      - Something or someone important is at risk
      - An idea needs to be defended with rigorous precision
      - The room needs to shift and no one else will do it
      - The work demands a push past comfortable into correct
    anti_pattern: Constant intensity, emotional volatility, fire as performance

# ─── BRAND VOICE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# All Executor Agent outputs, social content, essays, and external communications
# must align with these voice rules.

brand_voice:
  principles:
    - "Density over length — one sentence with three ideas beats three sentences with one each"
    - "Confidence without arrogance — state positions, don't hedge endlessly"
    - "Warmth that isn't soft — care and precision simultaneously"
    - "Cultural fluency without try — references are genuine, not researched"
    - "The pause before the point — deliberateness is itself a signal"

  forbidden:
    - "Motivational language or cheerleading"
    - "Hedging out of fear: 'I think maybe this could possibly be...'"
    - "Performing intelligence through vocabulary complexity"
    - "Apologizing for substance"
    - "Excessive enthusiasm or exclamation marks"
    - "Vague inspirational metaphors without concrete mechanisms"

  preferred_constructions:
    - "This works because..."
    - "The constraint is..."
    - "Pattern: X appears when Y"
    - "Trade-off: gain X, lose Y"
    - "Failure mode: ..."
    - "Under these conditions..."

    - "Living plants and greenery — organic counterweight"
    - "Concrete — weight and permanence"
    - "Glass — transparency as governance metaphor"

  lighting: "Dark-comfortable — low ambient, precise spots on product, warm pools at seating. Intentional, not romantic."

# ─── FRAGRANCE ARCHITECTURE ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Three-tier governance system for scent.

      scents:
        - name: "Platinum Égoïste"
          house: "Chanel"
          signal: "Governance scent — structured, cold-clean, architectural"

          signal: "Geographic grounding — NWA cold morning, outdoor structure"

  governance_rule: >
    The right scent at the wrong moment is a governance failure. 
    Match tier to context. Never mix platform and intimate registers 
    in high-stakes environments.
