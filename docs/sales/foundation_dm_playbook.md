# FOUNDATION DM Playbook

## Inbound Reply (When Someone DMs FOUNDATION)
Send this first:

`Perfect. FOUNDATION is my 7-day Permanence OS setup on Mac. I'll send a short intake now, then we book a 20-minute fit call.`

## Intake Questions (DM or Form)
1. What do you need this system to handle first (content, research, ops, or all)?
2. Are you on Mac full-time?
3. What tools are currently most painful?
4. Do you prefer pilot/core/operator setup scope?
5. Earliest kickoff date this week?

## Fit Response (Qualified)
`You are a fit. Next step is a 20-minute call to lock scope and kickoff timeline. After the call, I send a same-day invoice and we start.`

## Not Fit Response (Unqualified)
`I don't want to over-promise this if fit is off. I can put you on the waitlist and send the prep checklist so we can run this when your setup is ready.`

## Follow-Up Sequence
- +24h no reply:
`Quick bump. If you still want FOUNDATION this week, send your best kickoff window and I'll lock it.`
- +72h no reply:
`Closing this thread for now so I can hold delivery slots. If you want in, send FOUNDATION again and I'll reopen.`

## Guardrails
- No custom promises outside locked deliverables.
- No price negotiation in long text threads; move to call.
- Keep one CTA only: `DM "FOUNDATION"`.
