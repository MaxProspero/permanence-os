# Compression Framework

Permanence OS uses three compression layers to reduce complexity into stable rules.

## 1) Signal Compression
- Filter inputs before they compete for attention
- Focus on high-signal sources

## 2) Decision Compression
- Convert repeated choices into defaults
- Thresholds over debates

## 3) Identity Compression
- Define behavior independent of mood
- Systems that pass the 2 AM Test
